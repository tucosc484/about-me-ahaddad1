## 1. What is your developer journey so far? What brought you to this major, and why did you take this class?
My developer journey thus far is Java at Towson University and some Python. In my current job, I don't do software development on a daily basis and sometimes have to go back and relearn how to do something. In college, I was interested in Math from the beginning, but didn't realize computer science was the field I wanted to get into till much later. I enrolled in this class because I need exposure to web development to decide if this is the area of computer science I would enjoy working in.
## 2. What is your ideal career progression, if there were no limitations?
My ideal career progression is to work at NSA dealing with encryption since it involves math and computer science. Also, I'm interested in networking and data analysis.
## 3. What programming experience do you have? Do you have any web experience?
My programming experience is in Java and Python. I don't have any recent practical web experience. I can remember doing an HTML project during my junior year of high school and we had to type out all of the HTML code to make hyperlinks and what not. That was back when Dreamweaver was the latest and greatest thing.
